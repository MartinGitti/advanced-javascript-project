## In order to use the code displayed above:
<p>I'd recommend opening the code files in a Text Editor.</p>

<p>To run the code in a Text Editor, run the code in the terminal or command prompt.</p>
<p>In order to run and test code in the terminal, typer "node 'filename that you want to run/test'."</p>
<p>Please feel free to make use of the code.</p>
