# first-look-at-javascript
<p>This is my first project working with JavaScript.</p>
*This project takes a look at some of the basics, specifically looking at Variables and Operators of JavaScript.

## Introduction to JavaScript:

## Within the project, we'll take a look at a few javaScript basics:
* Console.log= Displaying info in console.
* Data Types.
* Variables.
* Operators.

<b>Please note:</b>

* In order to run code in the console, it is important to install Node.js first.
* Run code or display variables in the console by typing "node & 'File Name'".
* Example: 'node dataType.js'.
* Bare in mind that this needs to be typed within the command line interface/terminal.

## In order to use the code displayed above:
<p>I'd recommend opening the code files in a Text Editor.</p>
<p>You can use any text editor of your choice, I've made use of Visual Studio Code.</p>
<p>To run the code in a Text Editor, run the code in the terminal or command prompt.</p>
<p>In order to run and test code in the terminal, typer "node 'filename that you want to run/test'."</p>
<p>Please feel free to make use of the code.</p>
